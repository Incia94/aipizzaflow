# PizzaFlow AI

A full-stack restaurant management system built as a deliberate exercise in software architecture methodology — Domain-Driven Design, Clean Architecture, and bounded contexts applied to a real product problem.

> **Built for a pizza restaurant owner (Rajan) who needs to manage orders, track business intelligence, and ask natural-language questions about his business.**

---

## What it does

**Customer Portal** (public)
- Build and submit pizza orders — choose base, toppings, quantity
- Complete checkout with payment method (Card, Cash, UPI)
- Receive a fully itemised receipt with GST breakdown

**Admin Portal** (JWT-protected)
- Real-time analytics dashboard — revenue, sales, customer retention, payment distribution
- AI Restaurant Advisor — ask natural-language questions, get data-grounded answers
- Month-over-month and week-over-week growth metrics

---

## Architecture

The backend is organised into **6 bounded contexts**, each owning its own models, repository, service, and routes. No context reaches into another's internals.

```
Reference       →  Menu items (seed data, read-only)
Order           →  Customer + Order lifecycle (Pending state)
Checkout        →  Bill + Payment, atomic transition to Paid state
Analytics       →  Business Intelligence computed on every request (never persisted)
AI Advisor      →  Receives only the BI Model; LLM reasons, never calculates
Auth            →  JWT login; Customer Portal is public, Admin Portal is protected
```

**Key architectural principle:** Business Intelligence is computed by Python. The LLM only receives structured metrics and returns reasoning. It never touches the database, performs calculations, or sees raw data.

```
Request → AnalyticsService → Python computes BI Model
                                        ↓
                             AIService formats as text
                                        ↓
                             OpenRouterClient → GPT-4o-mini
                                        ↓
                             Natural language answer returned
```

## Running locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/das0777/PIZZA-FLOW.git
cd PIZZA-FLOW
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set your OPENROUTER_API_KEY, ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD, SECRET_KEY
```

`.env` reference:

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./pizzaflow_local.db

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
OPENROUTER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

MENU_FILE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/scripts/menu.csv

ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword
SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret-key
```

Start the server:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

Optionally seed 60 days of realistic mock data for the AI Advisor:

```bash
python ../scripts/seed_mock_data.py
```

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite proxies `/api` → `http://localhost:8001` automatically.

### 4. Access the app

| Portal | URL | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| Customer Portal | http://localhost:5173/order | Public |
| Admin Login | http://localhost:5173/admin/login | — |
| Analytics | http://localhost:5173/admin/analytics | JWT required |
| AI Advisor | http://localhost:5173/admin/ai | JWT required |
| API Docs | http://localhost:8001/docs | — |

## Running tests

```bash
cd backend
pytest ../tests/ -v
```

```
tests/contexts/reference/    15 passed
tests/contexts/order/        30 passed
tests/contexts/checkout/     28 passed
tests/contexts/analytics/    23 passed
tests/contexts/ai_advisor/   22 passed
─────────────────────────────────────
118 passed, 0 failed
```

Tests use in-memory SQLite with `StaticPool` — no test database files, no external services. The LLM client is mocked in all AI Advisor tests.

## Design decisions worth noting

**Why is the BI Model never persisted?**  
Analytics are computed fresh on every request from the immutable transaction record (bills + payments). This means filters (date range, customer, payment method, pizza) work correctly without maintaining a separate aggregation table. Principle 9.

**Why does the AI receive structured text instead of raw database rows?**  
The LLM's role is reasoning, not calculation. Passing raw data would risk hallucinated arithmetic. `AnalyticsService` computes every number; `AIService` formats it as prose and passes it to the LLM as a read-only briefing. The LLM interprets and advises — it never calculates.

**Why is Checkout atomic?**  
`Order → Paid`, `Bill`, and `Payment` are written in a single database transaction. If payment recording fails, the order stays `Pending`. There is no half-paid state. Principle 8 / Rule 8.

**Why are historical prices captured at checkout time?**  
Menu prices can change. The `unit_price` on `OrderItem` and `gst_rate` on `Bill` are captured at the moment of transaction — not looked up later. This ensures bills are legally accurate even after price updates. Principle 18.

## What's next (v2 ideas)

- Production deployment (Railway/Render backend, Vercel frontend, Supabase PostgreSQL)
- Multi-item order editing before checkout
- Customer order history and loyalty tracking
- Scheduled weekly AI digest report
- Push notifications for new orders
